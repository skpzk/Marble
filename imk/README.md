Isomorphic midi keyboard

Calibration :  
- press calibrate main keyboard button.
- type every key on a row starting by the top one (eg. azerty... or 123456... depending on which row you choose to use).
- at the end of each row, press enter (which is not used as a note key).
- if you wish to use a keyboard with shift for a secondary keyboard (+/- one octave), it should be calibrated also with the "calibrate secondary keyboard" button. This function is not implemented yet.

To be done :
- calibration of shift keyboard
- give user option to load a configuration file.
- option to change base note (ie the bottom left one)
- option to change intervals of the isomorphic keyboard
- option to use different keys for octave +/-
- option to set interval of the shift kbd
- works only if launched from build folder, to be improved
- add cancel calibration button
